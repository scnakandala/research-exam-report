\section{Open Challenges}
Integrating ML methods into DBMS components has proven to optimize system performance.
In fact some systems have already integrated ML into enterprise DBMSs~\cite{leo, cardlearner, verdict}.
However, the field is still in its infancy and requires solving many open challenges in order to realize the full potential.
Next, we identify three such major open challenges:
